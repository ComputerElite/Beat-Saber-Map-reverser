# Beat-Saber-Map-reverser
Reverses Beat Saber maps

# Usage
Download the program from [releases](https://github.com/ComputerElite/Beat-Saber-Map-reverser/releases) and download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) and move it next to the exe (ffmpeg is being used to reverse the audio). Without it, the program will not work.
1. Start the program
2. Deag and drop your song (as zip) into the program and hit enter

Now next to the exe you'll see a zip file with the suffix `_reversed`
